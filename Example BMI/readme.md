# BMI Example

This example is intended as a very small demonstration of how to interact with the user, modulation of the files, calculate values introduced by ther user though the console, return the result and print a message depending on the result.

## THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT MEAN TO BE A DIAGNOSIS TOOL OR A WAY TO EVADE THE DOCTOR

In fact, I'm a Med Stundent and I highly recommended going to the doctor if you have any concern about your health.

Independently of the result or message that this program gives to you, It doesn't means anything without a professional interpretation and him/she to know your whole health status. So take this just as a small program and leave as it is.

That being said, I hope you enjoy this very small program as much as I did building it.

If you have some suggetion don't doubt to tell me!

# Program showcase:

Once the program starts, it shows the next messages and then waits for the user to introduce his weight in kilograms:

After entering the weight in kilograms, not ask the users height in meters:

Both parameters have to be in this units (kilograms/meters) because of the formula of the BMI: 

## weight/(heightÂ²)

If the user accidently enters this parameters in other units, the program continues giving **MISLEADING INFORMATION ABOUT HIS/HER BMI**

Once both parameters are entered correctly, the program calculates the BMI, returns it and shows the classification that the patient has:
