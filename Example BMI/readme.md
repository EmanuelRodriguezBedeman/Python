# BMI Example

This example is intended as a very small demonstration of how to interact with the user, modulation of the files, calculate values introduced by ther user though the console, return the result and print a message depending on the result.

## THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT MEAN TO BE A DIAGNOSIS TOOL OR A WAY TO EVADE THE DOCTOR

In fact, I'm a Med Stundent and I highly recommended going to the doctor if you have any concern about your health.

Independently of the result or message that this program gives to you, It doesn't means anything without a professional interpretation and him/she to know your whole health status. So take this just as a small program and leave as it is.

That being said, I hope you enjoy this very small program as much as I did building it.

If you have some suggetion don't doubt to tell me!
