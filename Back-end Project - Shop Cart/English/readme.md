# Shop-Cart project

This project is very similar to the one done I did with Ruby, check it out on this [link](https://github.com/EmanuelRodriguezBedeman/Ruby/tree/main/Small%20Back-End%20Project%20Shop%20Cart/English).

The main difference is that this project is made with Python and it has some new features.

# Program Sample:

# Program features:
## Enter a product to the Shop-Cart

If you start the program it shows a welcome message and the list of the product with their value:

> _the values are in Pesos Argentinos_

If by mistake you introduce a **product which isn't inside the list, you will get an error message** and be asked again to introduce the name of one of the products:

This message repeats until you **enter the name of one of the products.**

## Add another product to the Shop-Cart

Once you enter the name of a products in the list, the program asks you if you want to add another product to the cart and ask you to say "Yes" or "No".

If you enter something different than that, the program shows an error message and tells you to enter "Yes" or "No".

When you enter "Yes" into the console, the program shows the list of products again and ask you to enter the name of one of them (same as before).

After entering the name of the product, it ask again if you want to enter another product to the cart:

> (_As before, it will return an error message if you enter something different than the name of a product_)

This happens until you enter the "No", which takes you to the third part of the program:

## Adding bags for your products

Again, if you enter something different than "Yes" or "No" an error message shows up.

- If you enter **"Yes"**, the  program ask you how many bags do you want:

Again, an error will show up if you enter something different than a number. 

Once you enter the number, the program goes to it's final part. (_Read Below_)

- If you enter **"No"**, the amount of bags is set to 0 and the final part of the program starts with 0 bags on the shop cart.

## Final part of the program, show Shop-Cart content and total value:

This part shows the products inside the cart, their price, the amount of bags, the total value of bags, the tax price and the total value of the cart + bags + taxes:
