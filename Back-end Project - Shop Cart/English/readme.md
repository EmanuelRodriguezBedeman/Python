# Shop-Cart project

This project is very similar to the one done I did with Ruby, check it out on this [link](https://github.com/EmanuelRodriguezBedeman/Ruby/tree/main/Small%20Back-End%20Project%20Shop%20Cart/English).

The main difference is that this project is made with Python (obviously) and it has some new features.

# Showcase of the program

If you start the program it shows a welcome message and the list of the product with their value:

> _the values are in Pesos Argentinos_

If by mistake you introduce a product which isn't inside the list, you will get an error message and be asked again to introduce the name of one of the products:
