# Flip Word Example

On this example I'll leave the code to flip a word inside a sentence (or only a word) based on the number of characters that it has. 

# Example showcase:

If you run the program it will ask you to introduce a sentence or just a word:

After that, it'll ask you how many characters does the word should have to be flipped:

After entering a number (for this example 5), the program will flip the word that has 5 characters on it:
